# 102_Projects
102 C Programming Language course about Algorithmic approach, Control Structures, Declarations, Functions and Arrays, Structures, Pointers and Strings, Input Output and File Processing, Preprocessor Directives, Data Structures, Linking other libraries. This repository contains a collection of C projects demonstrating various algorithms and functionalities. Below is a brief overview of each project included in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. CountSort.c

This project implements the Count Sort algorithm. Count Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers. It works by counting the occurrences of each distinct element and then calculating their positions in the sorted output.

### 2. DuplicateReplacer.c

This project identifies and replaces duplicate characters in a given string. It helps in string manipulation tasks where duplicate removal or replacement is required.

### 3. LogicalGatesProcessor.c

This project simulates basic logical gate operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc. It processes input values and provides the output based on the specified logical operation.

### 4. ObjectPriceCalculator.c

This project calculates the price of objects based on given criteria. It is useful for scenarios where you need to determine the cost of items dynamically.

### 5. PolyProcessor.c

This project performs polynomial operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation. It handles polynomial expressions and computes results based on user input.

### 6. TerrainAnalyzer.c

This project analyzes terrain data and provides insights such as elevation, slope, and other geographical metrics. It is useful for geographical data analysis and visualization.

### 7. ParenthesisDepthPrinter.c

This project calculates and prints the depth of nested parentheses in a given expression. It is useful for parsing and analyzing expressions with nested structures.
